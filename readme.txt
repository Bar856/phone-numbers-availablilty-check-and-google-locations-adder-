this project is custom build by me for 3 options
1. getting large csv file and remove the blank lines
2. check phone numbers availability and create a new csv file with the free ones.
3. getting csv file with Google username, password and businesses information and trying to add as a new location
4. searching for offline domains from the csv file and creating a new file with the free ones.
